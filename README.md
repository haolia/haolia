### **I live to solve problems using analytics!**

#### <p align="justified">  📊 I attained my Bachelor of **Geophysical Engineering** in **Universitas Pertamina** in 2020. Through the experience of doing my final project before graduation, with the title: **"The Tectonic Pattern of the Sunda-Banda Arc Transition Zone based on Double Difference Tomography"**, I found myself naturally drawn towards data science through my passion for data and statistics. For me, data analysis is a way to identify patterns, detect key issues among outliers and tell valuable stories to make an impact. That's why in 2021, I decided to go deep and move on to data science! 

#### <p align="justified"> ✍️ To improve my knowledge as a data scientist, I'm currently pursuing Bootcamp Data Science Rakamin Academy, where I have developed skills in statistical analysis, computer programming, algorithm design, and working with big data sets in a supercomputing environment. 

#### <p align="justified"> ✨ I rely on using SQL to obtain and prepare my data, heavily utilizing Python to clean, analyze, visualize and perform machine learning on big data sets. 

#### :smiley: :smiley: **Fun facts:**

   ##### ✨ Spend hours to beautify my code and GitHub markdown because my OCD cannot stand reading sloppy documentation.
   ##### 🤔 I don’t trust people who don’t write SQL queries in uppercase.
   ##### 📈 Particularly interested in Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning and applying statistical models to solve interesting novel business problems.
