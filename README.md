:ok_woman: Hello, I’m Haolia and I live to solve problems using analytics!

📊 I attained my Bachelor of Geophysical Engineering in Universitas Pertamina in 2020. Through the experience of doing my final project before graduation, with the title: "The Tectonic Pattern of the Sunda-Banda Arc Transition Zone based on Double Difference Tomography", I found myself naturally drawn towards data science through my passion for data and statistics. For me, data analysis is a way to identify patterns, detect key issues among outliers and tell valuable stories to make an impact. That's why in 2021, I decided to go deep and move on to data science!

✍️ To improve my knowledge as a data scientist, I'm currently pursuing Bootcamp Data Science Rakamin Academy, where I have developed skills in statistical analysis, computer programming, algorithm design, and working with big data sets in a supercomputing environment. 

✨ I rely on using SQL to obtain and prepare my data, heavily utilizing Python to clean, analyze, visualize and perform machine learning on big data sets. 

:thought_balloon: Quotes I Lived By:
“You said I dream too big, I said you think too small.”

:smiley: Fun facts:

✨ Spend hours to beautify my code and GitHub markdown because my OCD cannot stand reading sloppy documentation.
🤔 I don’t trust people who don’t write SQL queries in uppercase.
📈 Particularly interested in Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning and applying statistical models to solve interesting novel business problems.
